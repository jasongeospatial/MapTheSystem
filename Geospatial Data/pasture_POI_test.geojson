In colder climes however, yaks and camels are hardier and are better at defending themselves, removing the need to gather and shelter them each night.

These herders hold pre-school classes for three hours in their yurts, emphasizing play and exploration of local materials. This initiative is enormously popular and has helped bridge the gap for children that spend their summers on the pastures." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 77.195895586861909, 41.478898554028717 ] } }
